Audience Podcast Panel
<p>We are very grateful to all of our TWiT listeners who participated in our annual TWiT Audience Survey earlier this year, as your feedback helps us enhance programming and select high-integrity advertisers.</p>
<p>Recently, Podtrac Analytics reached out to TWiT with another survey opportunity for our TWiT audience. Podtrac is giving avid podcast fans the opportunity to share their thoughts and opinions on podcasting through the Podtrac Audience Panel. Your participation will help the podcast industry, including the TWiT network, by providing anonymous information about the trends and needs of podcast audiences. Participation includes no more than 6 yearly podcast related surveys, and you can unsubscribe at any time. Additionally, some surveys may offer free gift cards as a thank you for participating. If you&rsquo;re interested, you can sign up by entering your name and email at&nbsp;<a href="http://podtrac.com/panel" target="_blank">podtrac.com/panel</a>.</p>
<p>As always, we are very grateful to all of our TWiT listeners, as your support makes all of this possible.</p>

TWiT's 2016 Audience Survey is Now Open
<div id="_mcePaste"><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/twit2016" target="_blank"><img src="http://inside.twit.tv/storage/TWiT-with-bug-200-trans.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1454885355490" alt="" /></a></span></span><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/twit2016" target="_blank">Our annual TWiT Audience Survey is now open</a>. It should take 5-10 minutes of your time and that contribution is so valuable to us.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We do this once a year to get a general idea of who our audience is, both to help us make better programming and help us pick advertisers we think you'd be interested in.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<div id="_mcePaste">I understand that some of the demographic questions here are personal. We do not identify you in any way in this survey and we only use the aggregate information from the roughly 20,000 responses we get each year. (Things like: "50% of our audience has a college degree or better.")</div>

<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<div id="_mcePaste">If you feel uncomfortable about answering any of the questions, please skip them. (That's better than making up an answer, by the way. No information is much better than misinformation.) I know many of you take privacy very seriously, and I promise always to protect that.</div>

Tech News Today
<div id="_mcePaste"><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><a href="https://twit.tv/tnt" target="_blank"><img src="http://inside.twit.tv/storage/tech-news-today.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1453851275918" alt="" /></a></span></span>We&rsquo;re barely a month into the new <a href="https://twit.tv/tnt" target="_blank">Tech News Today</a>, and avid viewers ranging from our parents to some guy who randomly found us on his Roku are telling us they like what we&rsquo;re doing!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>We&rsquo;ve been playing with the format all month, and zeroing in on what we think fans of daily tech news might want: Top stories, engaging interviews, and a healthy dose of humor and personality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<div>First, we want to give you a rundown of all the important tech news of the day-- It could be anything with a chip in it, the next social media platform, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning, self-driving cars, smart appliances, drones, and so much more. Beyond that, how are these behemoth tech companies fighting for our collectively sticky eyeballs? It&rsquo;s all fair game.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<div id="_mcePaste">But the important distinction is that, whatever we talk about, it has to be the stuff that affects our lives. To that end, we might choose to pass on things like mergers, acquisitions, and quarterly earnings. That is, of course, unless they truly mean something to the big picture.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We aren&rsquo;t the only voice you&rsquo;ll hear on this show, nor do we want to be. In addition to our creative team at TWiT, we are drawing heavily on the opinions and perspectives of our daily guests who will join us in contributing to the entire show. That guest might be a journalist, a podcaster, a YouTuber, or just a tech expert. If they share a passion of technology, their point of view is valuable to the greater conversation. We&rsquo;ll also interview other journalists, experts, professors, and creators whenever stories arise that can benefit from their background and expertise.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<div id="_mcePaste">Further, we want you to be a part of the show too! Send us your comments, suggestions, videos, voicemails, and social updates, and we&rsquo;ll do our very best to bring you into the conversation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We know that everyone is busy and you have endless choices of what to watch and listen to. Most of all, we want you to know that we value your time and are grateful that you've chosen to spend some of your time with us.</div>
<div></div>
